## Distance Arbitrage aka Distarb

## Contents:
* ### [distarb.app](https://github.com/Daegybyte/distarb/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
	
* ### paper

* ### app
	* Contains copies of the source code in `distarb.app/Contents/Resources/app/`.


## Setup:

### A `.zip` of the current release of Distarb can be found [here](https://github.com/UtahMSD/diegoPisciotta/releases/tag/1.1.0).
<br/>


### Why doesn't this work?


#### In the event the executable fails, try:
 
 - Right clicking the application and clicking run. This will circumvent Apple trying to protect you from unidentified developers.

#### If that fails:

 - In your terminal, navigate to where you see '`distarb.app`' and run the script: 
 
 $`bash distarb.app/Contents/MacOS/distarb`
 
 It is worth noting that this may be necessary to get the webscraper to work.
 
 - 

If the above fails and you are having environment issues,  A `.yml` of the conda environement to run the application can be found [here](https://anaconda.org/daegybyte/distarb).

## Instructions:

In the program window, select the radio button for what functionality you are interested in. The default button on the left is to figure out the edit distance using the distance calculating algorithm. The results will be ranked by edit and physical distance. The two dropdowns at the top allow you to select a company by either its company name, or its ticker name. The right radio button activates the webscraper.

### Miscellaneous:
 
No animals were harmed in the making of this program. However one particularly happy corgi did receive many treats fromt the treat jar on my desk. He is becoming a bit of a chunk as a result. 


#### Like keys on a keyboard, your turn signal is not that far from your fingers. Use it.
